# Thrash Band

# by Stephen Whittington

This website is based on a Thrash metal band called Mutually Assured Destruction short for M.A.D, It was built for user purpose to see upcoming
tour dates and new band material when available, Also to get the band hired for events such as weddings and birthdays. It contains a simple layout and navigation
for the user to navigate their way through a 5 page responsive website that not only looks good on mobile first but desktop as well.

The Web page is mainly aimed at the fan base and shows the bands most recent recordings/Music with a video file and youtube footage of the band playing live and
recording in the studio, It also shows all dates and venues for the bands upcoming UK tour in june/july 2019. 

## UX process for my Website

I started with a desktop layout for the website using figma, The site is aimed at the fan base so i wanted the user to be able to navigate easily
to each page without any hesitation. The fan wants to be able to see the latest recordings or music the band has made, So by a page link to music they can see
the latest uploads from the band with a sign up form to the site to let them know of any updates ASAP.

### List of user Stories

* As a user/fan, I want to hear and view the latest content, so i can keep up with the bands profile.
* As a user/fan, I want to see information on the next tour/event, so i can choose dates and buy tickets.
* As a customer, I want to be able to fill out a book-ins form, so i can hire the band for a wedding or birthday party.
* As a user/fan, I want to be able to access the bands social pages, so i can communicate by social media.
* As a user/fan, I want to be able to see information and pictures of the band/members, so i can get to know the band without meating them
