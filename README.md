# Milestone Project 1

# by Stephen Whittington

This website is based on a Thrash metal band called Mutually Assured Destruction short for M.A.D, It was built for user purpose to see upcoming
tour dates and new band material when available, Also to get the band hired for events such as weddings and birthdays. It contains a simple layout and navigation
for the user to navigate their way through a 5 page responsive website that not only looks good on mobile first but desktop as well.

The project is mainly aimed at the fan base and shows the bands most recent recording's/Music with links to youtube footage of the band playing live and
recording in the studio, It also shows all dates and venues for the bands upcoming UK tour in june/july 2019.
